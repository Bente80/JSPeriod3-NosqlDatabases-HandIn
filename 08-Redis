08.	Explain how redis "fits" into the NoSQL world, and provide an example of how to use it.

See question 3, for the answer to this.

Example:

This is the basic anatomy of a Redis command. First we have the actual command, in this case set. Next we have its parameters.
The set command takes two parameters: the key we are setting and the value we are setting it to. Many, but not all, commands take a key
(and when they do, itâ€™s often the first parameter).

set users:leto '{"name": "leto", "planet": "dune", "likes": ["spice"]}'

This is how to retrieve this value:

get users:leto

For an example in webstorm look at my own project: JSPEriod3Redish.
