Period-3 NoSQL MongoDB + mongoose and Redis.

By Bente Andersen

This file is meant to give you an overview of this hand in. I will make one file for each question, but the example
code for this hand in will mostly come from three different git-hub repositories I have made. I will link to these
through here, and tell you where to look for what in each question.
I have put in examples of the code in some of the questions, but they wonÂ´t work here. In order to look how it works,
you need to go to the repositories below.

The repositories are named:

JSPeriod3Mean1          -   https://github.com/Bente80/JSPeriod3Mean1
* This project is my solution to the questions found in MongoEx-1.pdf (0.1) found on Fronter.

JSPeriod3RedisSession   -	https://github.com/Bente80/JSPeriod3RedisSession
JSPEriod3Redish.        -   https://github.com/Bente80/JSPeriod3Redis
* These projects are my solution to the questions found in Redis as a Session Store.pdf found on Fronter.

The sources I have used for this project is written in each question.
