04.	Explain reasons to add a layer like Mongoose, on top on of a schema-less database like MongoDB.

The reasons for using a layer like Mongoose, on top on of a schema-less database like MongoDB could be:
o	Real life data has (often) structure.
o	Real life data has (often) types.
o	We want to do more with less work ;-)

Another reason is, that Mongoose allows us to have access the MongoDB commands for CRUD simply and easily.

Futhermore Mongoose offers more functionality (one of them is being an ODM (Object Document Mapping)).

Mongoose also adds in some necessary data manipulation functions and it works as a layer to be used for
future additions (plugins) , rather than messing with the source of MongoDB itself.

With mongoose, you also got update, delete, validation framework, support for custom middleware etc.

By using Mongoose you also avoid dealing with deep callback structures.

Futhermore Mongoose provides a way to refer one collection from another (kind of like join between two tables  in SQL).
(Mongoose Query Population v4.4.3.)
This is very helpful if you don't want put all your data into a single collection.

Mongoose also has pre save and post save hooks to do something before and after you save a model. Pre-save hook can be
used to simulate 'cascade on delete'  in Mongodb.
